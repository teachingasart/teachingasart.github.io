<p>Teaching as Art is a class about pedagogy, artist run schools and social practice art. The class has been offered as a graduate level course offered at <a href="https://tisch.nyu.edu/itp">NYU ITP</a> in <a href="https://github.com/teachingasart/2019">2019</a>, <a href="https://github.com/teachingasart/2018">2018</a>, <a href="https://github.com/teachingasart/2017">2017</a> and a day long workshop at the <a href="http://eyeofestival.com/2017/speaker/taeyoon-choi/">Eyeo Festival</a>.</p>

<p>Professor: <a href="https://taeyoonchoi.com">Taeyoon Choi</a></p>

<p>with assistance from: <a href="https://twitter.com/shirarbira">Shira Feldman</a></p>

<p>This class is for artists and creative technologists who want to teach. A good teacher is also a great student themself. They transform their curiosity into knowledge and share their learning processes with others. One can learn to become a better teacher by staying fearless about ‘not knowing’ something, embracing radically open ideas and connecting various expertise and knowledge. Teaching can be a form of artistic and creative practice in collaboration with a diverse community. Teachers can invent new forms of learning spaces, new kinds of collaboration and new senses of community.</p>
