<p>A graduate level course offered at <a href="https://tisch.nyu.edu/itp">NYU ITP</a> in Spring 2019</p>

<p>Saturdays 12:00 ~ 4:25pm ITP Room 50</p>

<p>Professor: Taeyoon Choi trc6@nyu.edu</p>

<p>with assistance from: <a href="https://twitter.com/shirarbira">Shira Feldman</a></p>

<p>This class is for artists and creative technologists who want to teach. A good teacher is also a great student themself. They transform their curiosity into knowledge and share their learning processes with others. One can learn to become a better teacher by staying fearless about ‘not knowing’ something, embracing radically open ideas and connecting various expertise and knowledge. Teaching can be a form of artistic and creative practice in collaboration with a diverse community. Teachers can invent new forms of learning spaces, new kinds of collaboration and new senses of community.</p>
