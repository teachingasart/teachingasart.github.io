**Teaching as Art Day** is a culmination of a 6-week course, [*Teaching as Art*](https://github.com/teachingasart/2019), in which students explored teaching as a form of artistic and creative practice. Students explored curricula and syllabus building, focusing on socially-engaged art, museums and communities as schools, and inclusive learning. This year, we focused particularly on the works of Simone Leigh and Anni Albers. 

Over the course of 5 weeks, students had the chance to visit [Recess](https://www.recessart.org/about/) and meet educator Raven Stubbs, in addition to learning from Maia Ruth Lee, Director and Artist Liaison at [Wide Rainbow](http://widerainbow.org/).

For their final projects, students were instructed to create their own workshops, centered around the intersections of art, technology, and social justice. At Teaching as Art Day, students will present their workshops and learn together. Teaching as Art Day will be held from 12 - 5 pm at [Elmer S. Bobst Library](https://www.nyu.edu/academics/libraries/elmer-holmes-bobstlibrary.html) and is free and open to the public. Special thanks to Zach Cobble, a librian at NYU Bobst and former Teaching as Art student.
